TITLE

ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

RELATED WORD??
    - Python Libraries for Facial Recognition and Feature Extraction:
        i. face_recognition
        ii. open_cv
        iii. Deep EXtraction (Caffe not Python)
        iv. TensorFlow python

METHODOLOGY
    - Research Questions
        i. gender prediction
        ii. racial prediction?? (controversial?)
        iii. transferable to other datasets
        iv. age prediction
        v. happiness classification??
        vi. eyes closed??
        vii. eye colour prediction

    - Data Preperation & Cleaning
    - Data Analysis

EXPECTED RESULTS

DISCUSSION??

CONCLUSION

1. Applicability/Feasability of the work
2. Type of information you can get from a headshot
    - Race
    - Eyecolor
    - gender
3. Comparisons between different apis (amazon and google)
4. Add noise to the datasets
    - Quality of image

Quality of image, size of image, person race, image filters, 

BIDMA must fill the template

Risk: Google API is not accurate enough
    - Not enough data to train the model
- Trying to collect as much data as possible to make a very general model
